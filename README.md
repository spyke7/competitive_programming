# Competitive Programming 
<br>

This is my collection of solutions to different problems that I practiced and 
solutions to the contests I have participated. I am newbie and still learn data structures and algorithms. So there can be inconsistency and wrong code and inefficient code. I am doing this to track my record. I would also be uploading solutions to famous problems and implementations of different algorithms.
Feel free to generate issues and pull request to make my code more good.
